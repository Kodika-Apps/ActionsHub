### `Initial Release`
# **Version 1.0**
ActionsHub, a GitHub Actions client, is the easiest way to view and manage your GitHub Actions Workflows on your mobile.

Features:
- Cancel or Re-run any Workflow Run with a single tap!
- Monitor the progress and status of any Workflow Run and its Steps.
- Connect directly to GitHub API. Your credentials are stored only on your device.
- All the Workflow Run info - status, branch, Pull Request, Commit - in one screen.

You will need to be a contributor to the repository to see it in the ActionsHub app.

You will need to give ‘repo’ and ‘workflow’ scopes to the generated GitHub Access Token for the app to be fully functional.

ActionsHub is not affiliated with GitHub in any way, and it is a third-party GitHub Actions client.
